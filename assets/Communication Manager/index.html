            <h3>My key accomplishments of this stage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>At the beginning of my contract, I updated our newsletter platform to ensure a better reading experience. By transitioning from Mailchimp to E-Goi, I successfully improved the opening,
                        clicking, and reading rates compared to previous years. Notably, the opening rate increased from 8% to 30%. This change involved a complete overhaul of the newsletter's look, the amount
                        of information shared, the colors used, and the scheduling of the send-outs.</li>
                    <li>One of the accomplishments I take great pride in is organizing and managing online events with over 300 participants. Remarkably, I achieved this without any prior experience in event
                        planning. The journey was both challenging and rewarding, requiring me to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies and logistics. Despite the initial hurdles, seeing the successful
                        execution of these events and the positive feedback from attendees was incredibly
                        fulfilling. It has instilled in me a strong sense of confidence and capability in tackling new and unfamiliar tasks.</li>
                </ul>

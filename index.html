        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>As a marketing graduate, my professional journey unexpectedly led me into the
            exciting world of events, and it's a path I've come to deeply embrace. What brings
            me the most joy is the direct interaction with clients, navigating their needs, and
            curating experiences that leave a lasting impact. While I'm more accustomed to
            organizing corporate events, I'm equally comfortable planning personal ones.
            In addition to my expertise in event management, I'm also a travel consultant
            specializing in tailor-made VIP trips in Portugal.</p>

        <p> To improve my quality of life, I made the exciting move to Ireland. I'm also
            expanding my skill set by diving into a Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp, aiming
            to enhance my knowledge and broaden my professional horizons. </p>
            
        <p>I am eagerly looking forward to advancing my career in a vibrant international
            setting where I can not only contribute my skills but also continue to learn, evolve,
            and cultivate meaningful connections in a dynamic professional environment.</p>
